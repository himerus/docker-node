For more documentation on how Outrigger images are constructed and how to work
with them, please [see the documentation](http://docs.outrigger.sh/).

## Usage Example

```
docker run -v ~/Project/node-app:/code outrigger/node
```

## Environment Variables

Outrigger images use Environment Variables and [confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd)
to "templatize" a number of Docker environment configurations. These templates are
processed on startup with environment variables passed in via the docker run
command-line or via your docker-compose manifest file. Here are the "tunable"
configurations offered by this image.

* `SKIP_NPM_INSTALL`: If this is set (to anything) it will not run `npm install` when the container boots.
